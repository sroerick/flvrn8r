# This is FLVRTRN
## Welcome to FLVRTWN

### how to access Raspberry pi:
ssh roerick@raspberrypi.local
sometimes I find that this weird little DNS Alias does not work. IP address is static, so 
ssh roerick@192.168.1.143 should work. 
pw is 'coffee'

##TODO make the python script run at startup

### main.py
main.py is the primary code which starts the MQTT server

### import.py takes the input csv and creates a Sqlite database
two tables are created
1. recipes - this is a 1 to 1 copy of the import CSV 
2. lookup - I took the output of recipes.columns, deleted the beans, and then assigned addresses

### lookup.py
lookup.py is the primary set of functions which navigates the SQL table. When you scan a barcode, this is called. 
It hits the recipe table, gets the appropriate recipe, and prints the information associated with the recipe. 
Then it hits the look up table and gets the box address (1-8), the pod address (1-8), and the flavor amount (what units are these lol)

### wifi.ino
This is the code which gets flashed to each ESP32 using ArduinoIDE 
TODO Map address - currently, Arduino IDE just receives pin number 



### Addresses 
Each flavor is assigned a box and a pod in the 'lookup' table. 
There are 8 pods per box. 





## Concerns
- I think that using jumper cables on the box was quite frankly a mistake. These should be soldered on. 
- The motor did not survive my ~12 hour stress test. It seemed to be running find at the end, although extremely hot and it kind of smelled bad. 
- I'm not sure what happens in the case of an MQTT desync
